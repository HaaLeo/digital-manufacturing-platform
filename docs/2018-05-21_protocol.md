# What have we done
* Forked [3D-Printer Use Case](https://git.fortiss.org/Blockchain/Demonstrator/3DPrinter-Composer)
* Tried to get it running
* Aligned Max what's the current state

# Next Steps
1. *@Leo*: Ask business partner for sample data (again) 
   * *@Max+1*: Define data model 

1. Get it running
    * How can we get the use case running using local BigChainDB or BigchainDB [testnet](https://testnet.bigchaindb.com/) (ask Tasos)

1. Remove unused models, scripts, views, etc. from the project. -> Document decissions and propose new (needed) components and refactor code (and add dummy models and components instead)

1. Second version of the process.png (sequence diagram in the docs folder) (define workflow with technologies and consider Dian's comments ->Slack)
   * Which transactions are needed / architecture

1. Decide on Architecture
    * Questions: Are the data maintained? Where do we store it? Where are the calculations done?
    * Critical Transactions:

    1. Printer uploads quality data
    1. Customer uploads requirements
    1. Store report on DB (blockchainy)
        1. Evaluate report by predefined algorithm
    1. Evaluation result is transfered to customer

1. Setup structure for midterm presentation -> **@Max**
   * Purpose and description of application
   * Roadmap with timeline
   * Business Model Canvas (BMC)
   * Aris Model (Concept, Data concept, Implementation) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture_of_Integrated_Information_Systems
   * Sum up development
* *@Max*: Checkout Mindsphere

# Deadlines
